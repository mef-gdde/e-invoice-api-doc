# Webhook
You can receive document notification updates by setting a webhook URL in the  [setting](https://caminv-dev-merc.mef.gov.kh/setting) under the "Credential" tab.

This webhook URL is used for updates from Caminv, such as **Invoice Received** and **Invoice Sent**
- **Invoice Sent**: This event is sent to the supplier after the invoice is attested and stored on the blockchain.
- **Invoice Received**: This event is sent to the customer after the invoice is attested and stored on the blockchain.

## What happen when Caminv can't send the invoice to destination?
Caminv will retry sending the invoice repeatedly after a failed transaction to the supplier or customer.

import React from 'react'
import { Callout, Bleed } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ¦¤">
  The webhook will retry **5 times**, once every hour. If the transaction still fails, Caminv will stop the automatic sending for that invoice.

  Suppliers can still manually send the invoice via the send invoice API.
</Callout>
