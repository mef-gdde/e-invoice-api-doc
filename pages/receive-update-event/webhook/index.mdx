# Getting Started: Webhook
This section outlines how to set up and use webhooks to receive real-time updates from the Caminvoice Network. These webhooks provide notifications when an invoice is sent, received, or its status is updated. By configuring your system to listen for these events, you can automate tasks and trigger actions based on invoice activity.

This webhook URL is used for updates from Caminvoice Network. These update notifications include:
- **Invoice Sent**: This event is sent to the supplier after the invoice is valid and stored on the blockchain.
- **Invoice Received**: This event is sent to the customer after the invoice is valid and stored on the blockchain.
- **Invoice Status Updated**: This event is sent to the supplier after the invoice status is updated by the customer.
